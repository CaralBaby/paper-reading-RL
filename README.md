1. Energent complexity via multi-agent competition
Reinforcement learning algorithms can train agents that solve problems in complex, interesting environments. Normally, the complexity of the trained agent is closely related to the complexity of the environment. This suggests that a highly capableagentrequiresacomplexenvironmentfortraining. Inthispaper,wepoint outthatacompetitivemulti-agentenvironmenttrainedwithself-playcanproduce behaviorsthatarefarmorecomplexthantheenvironmentitself. Wealsopointout thatsuchenvironmentscomewithanaturalcurriculum,becauseforanyskilllevel, an environment full of agents of this level will have the right level of difÔ¨Åculty. This work introduces several competitive multi-agent environments where agents compete in a 3D world with simulated physics. The trained agents learn a wide variety of complex and interesting skills, even though the environment themselves are relatively simple. The skills include behaviors such as running, blocking, ducking, tackling, fooling opponents, kicking, and defending using both arms and legs.
